# PROG2_Python_projekt

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of weather data for selected cities.
Leveraging information from a weather API and historical datasets, it calculates key statistics including temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and air pressure.
The system detects weather anomalies, identifies extreme events, and compares metrics across different cities.
An interactive console application enables users to explore data by city, date, or specific metrics in an intuitive way.
Additionally, the project automatically generates a professional PDF report featuring graphs, summaries, and tables, and supports exporting full analyses to CSV files.
