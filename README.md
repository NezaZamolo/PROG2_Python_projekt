# PROG2_Python_projekt

This project provides a comprehensive weather data analysis for selected cities. Using data from a weather API and historical sources, it calculates key statistics (temperature, precipitation, wind, pressure), detects weather anomalies, identifies extreme events, and compares metrics across cities. It offers an interactive console application that allows users to explore data by city, date, or specific metrics. Additionally, it automatically generates a PDF report containing graphs, summaries, and tables, and supports saving and loading the full analysis for continued use.
